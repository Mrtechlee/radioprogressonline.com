  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p><h3>BRIEF HISTORY OF RADIO PROGRESS</h3></p>

  <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
 <p>Radio Progress is a rural development -oriented Community Radio based in Wa in 
    the Upper West Region. It is operated by a local based registered Company Limited by 
    Guarantee known as Mass Media for Development (MMD).
    The principal aim of the Mass Media for Development is using radio for promoting,
     mobilizing and empowering the communities for development.</p>

    <p>MISSION</p>
  <p>A Development Community Radio station which serves as a development catalyst for the
     Upper West Region through effective participatory programs focusing on the felt needs 
     of all segments of the community.</p>
    
    <p>VISION</p>
  <p>A Development Oriented Community Radio station which seeks the active participation of 
     Community Members in the equitable and sustainable development of the Upper West Region.</p>
   
    <p>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</p>

    <p>The preparation for the opening of the Radio Station started in 1995 by a Belgium couple Bart
     & Ann and Brother Vincent Davies who were Missionaries working with the Department of Social
      Communication (DEPSOCOM) of the Catholic Diocese of Wa. By that time the Government had liberalized the allocation
       of radio frequencies. They applied to the Ghana Frequency Registration and Control Board now 
       National Communication Authority (NCA) for a license to operate a radio station. The Ghana Frequency 
       Allocation and Control Board wrote back to say that, Religious bodies were excluded from owning radio stations.</p>

    <p>STRATEGY</p>
  <p>The then Bishop of Wa Diocese, Most Reverend Paul Bemile sold the idea of opening the radio 
    station to some prominent persons of the region who formed an NGO known as Mass Media for 
    Development (MMD). The MMD applied for the license and frequency to start a Community radio 
    station and it was granted (98.1fm) in April, 1996.</p>

  <p> It is important to state that at that time
     the only source of news and information for the region was through GBC Radio Ghana which was 
     the preserve for only literates. The news papers for the day were delivered the following day 
     through the State Transport Corporation (STC) bus.  This underscores the urgent need for the 
     radio that can inform and educate the people of the Upper West Region in their own language. </p>

  <p>The first Board of Directors (BOD) for the MMD were: </p>
  <p>Peter Der (late)…………………. Chairman</p>
  <p>James B Dasah …………………..Vice Chairman</p>
  <p>Jacob Yir-erong (late) ……………Treasurer</p>
  <p> Lawrence Dakurah …………………..Secretary</p>
  <p>Celestina Bayor (late) ……………… Member</p>
  <p> Bishop Paul Bemile …………………. Member</p>
    
   <p> ON AIR on February 17, 1997, Radio Progress started broadcasting in a small area of about 6 kilometres 
    due to the small capacity of the transmitter of 5Watts. It is pertinent to state that through the 
    ingenuity of Bart & Ann and Brother Davies the 5 watts transmitter was donated by a Belgium based
     Catholic Organization, UNDA. In 1998, with the support from a Dutch Catholic Organization, BILANCE,
      a 500 watts transmitter was acquired and installed with a 35 metre tower.</p>
       
      <p>This increased the reception from the initial 6 kilometres to about 35 kilometres from Wa and subsequently a 
      2000watts (2kw) transmitter was acquired that transmits to a distance of about 100 kilometres
       radius. DEPSOCOM gave birth to Radio Progress and as such the first workers of the radio were
        staff of DEPSOCOM. They were; Lawrence Naaikuur who was the first Manager, then called Executive 
        Producer, Vitus Nambigne and Benjamin Musah (late). The first volunteer presenters were: 
        Susanna Atupri, Iddi Abdulai, Israel Zaghe, Doris Dery, Jerome Kpan and Bushirata Braimah.</p>


    <p>PROGRAMMES</p>
    Radio Progress being a community radio station and indeed the first Community radio in Ghana, 
    prioritized itself to the provision of vital information to help speed up the integral 
    development of the people. Our programs are focused on health and sanitation, agriculture 
    and environment, women and children, language and culture, civic education including human 
    rights and gender issues, school education and religion and others. Radio progress is now a 
    household name in the Wa municipality and those communities which receive its transmission. 
    The station concerns itself with what the people are doing to find sustainable solutions to 
    their problems, thus the radio is being used to promote participatory development of its catchment 
    area. Currently its signal covers Wa Municipality, Wa West district, Nadowli-Kaleo district, parts 
    of Wa East, parts of Daffiama-Bussie-Issa district and parts of Sawla-Tuna-Kalba district.</p>
